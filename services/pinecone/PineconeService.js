In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.\n\nTo exercise rights applicable to you as a data subject, you may write to us at\n\n[email\xa0protected] and raise a request for the specified right.

However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.\n\nBecause we maintain copies of personal information to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.\n\nFor archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.\n\nd. Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing\n\nFor withdrawing your consent at any time during the tenure of your services with us, you may choose to do so by sending us an e-mail at [email\xa0protected].

ONDC does not knowingly permit any person who is under 18 years of age to register with the services or to provide any other personally identifying information. If ONDC becomes aware that any personally identifiable information of persons less than 18 years of age has been collected on the website without verified parental consent, then ONDC will take the appropriate steps to delete any such information and notify the parent.\n\nHowever, we consider it the responsibility of parents to monitor their children’s use of our services. Nevertheless, it is our policy not to collect and process any personal information from children below 18 years of age or offer to send any promotional materials to persons in that category. ONDC does not seek or intend to seek or receive any personal information from children. Should a parent or guardian have reasons to believe that a minor has provided ONDC with personal information without their prior consent, please write at\n\n[email\xa0protected] to ensure that the personal information is removed from the website.\n\nSecurity and compliance with laws\n\nWe are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. Some of the safeguards we may use to protect your information are firewalls and data encryption, and information access controls.

They are also responsible for digitizing the seller's catalogue and dispersing payments. Additionally, they must train sellers on best practices in e-commerce to ensure quality fulfilment and provide a positive buying experience for customers.\n\nA Marketplace Seller Node (MSN) does not produce or manufacture any inventory of its own. It acts as a marketplace to offer goods and services that are provided by sellers.\n\nInventory Seller Node (ISN) is any application operated by a seller who produces or manufactures and sells its own inventory. It doesn’t include products/services by other sellers.\n\nHow to Join\n\nGateway's Role on ONDC\n\nGateway's are essential components in an open-network ecosystem, serving as technology providers to ensure that all sellers in the ONDC Network can be discovered. They facilitate multicasting by forwarding search requests from buyer applications to all seller applications and vice versa, as specified in the ONDC Network Policies. The Gateway service enables manual searches by end consumers by providing relevant product/service information from ONDC's seller universe.\n\nThis lets you:\n\nConnect seamlessly\n\nIncrease your reach & visibility\n\nGet relevant product/service information\n\nHow to Join\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow will ONDC help buyers/Customers?\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,\r\n                                                                sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore\r\n                                                                magna aliqua.

          "About Company\n\nCreating an inclusive ecosystem for e-commerce!\n\nBe a part of the world's first inclusive large-scale e-commerce system.\n\nIn India, more than 12 million sellers earn their livelihood by selling or reselling products and services. However, only 15,000 of these sellers (0.125% of the total) have enabled e-commerce. E‑retail has been out of reach for the majority of sellers, especially from small towns and rural areas.\n\nONDC recognises the unique opportunity to increase e‑retail penetration from the existing 4.3% to its maximum potential in India. Our mission is to dramatically increase e-commerce penetration in the country by enabling population-scale inclusion of all types and sizes of sellers.\n\nRead more\n\nWhy has India initiated this revolution?\n\nIndia has been a world leader in demonstrating the successful adoption of digital infrastructures at the population scale, such as UPI, AADHAAR, and more. ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) is yet another tech-based initiative to transform the way e-commerce functions in the country by enabling e-commerce through an open protocol based on open-source specifications.\n\nThe initiative will not only facilitate the rapid adoption of e-commerce but also boost and strengthen the growth of startups in India. By facilitating scalable and cost-effective e-commerce through the open protocol, ONDC will empower startups to grow collaboratively.\n\nInvestor Relations\n\nONDC was incorporated as a Section 8 company in December 2021, with the Quality Council of India and Protean eGov Technologies Limited as Founding Members.

These efforts ensured participants were mentored and well-equipped to create innovative solutions.\n\nThe last lap of this hackathon was a dynamic two-day event featuring action packed demo days held at the Google campus, culminating in a grand Award Ceremony to celebrate the most outstanding solutions. The demo days served as an opportunity for top 60 finalist teams to present their solutions, which were evaluated by a jury panel comprising industry leaders and business stalwarts. This  was followed by facilitating the winners in  the evening. The award ceremony graced by founders, CXOs and Venture Capitalists and  the prizes included Google Cloud Credit worth upto $ 202k, cash value of over 3 crore and an equity based grant of $ 250k  by Antler India.\n\nBuild for Bharat has proven to be more than just a hackathon; it's a movement to transform India's digital commerce landscape.

This has led to market inefficiencies, amalgamation of power in the hands of a few players in the space, thereby creating large entry barriers for medium and small-scale players to participate in the digital commerce ecosystem.\n\nAs a side effect of such inefficiencies, the consumers are also being subject to limited choices of products/sellers/services where options are limited to only the enabled categories and onboarded sellers and services. This requires buyers to use different apps for buying different products and services, being restricted for delivery time and cost only to the enabled logistics, and being dependent on the platforms for what is visible. India is a vast and diverse country and no platform has been able to do justice to this diversity. No surprise e-commerce penetration is at a mere 6%.\n\nOpen Protocol responds to these challenges by manifesting open networks based on the principles of interoperability and decentralisation.\n\nOpen Protocol consists of\n\nopen API specifications to enable seamless communication between consumers and providers across diverse platforms. These specifications provide common grammar for communication between two distinct platforms and create a decentralised, yet interoperable framework.\n\nThe commerce protocol and infrastructure that make up ONDC Network consist of two layers.\n\nA.

The current model of e-commerce stifles innovation, creates significant barriers to entry for new players, and creates a gap between online demand and the local retail ecosystem. As a result participation in e-commerce is well below its potential and has a tremendous opportunity to grow manifold.\n\nONDC, on the other hand, does not require that buyer and seller must use the same platform/application to do a business transaction. Instead, it is a network-centric model where, so long as platforms/applications are connected to this open network, buyers and sellers can transact irrespective of the platforms/applications they use. Its like the “UPI of e-commerce”.\n\nExisting Platform-Centric Model\n\nHere, buyers and sellers must use the same platform/application to do a business transaction\n\nONDC’s Network-Centric Model\n\nBuyers will be able to access all services currently provided by various sellers on different platforms, through a common network.\n\nWhat ONDC is:\n\nAn open network\n\nEliminates the need for a central intermediary\n\nAn enabler for e-commerce expansion\n\nAn enabler for broad-based innovation\n\nMarket and Community-led initiative\n\nWhat ONDC is NOT:\n\nAn application or a platform\n\nA central intermediary\n\nA medium to help digitize businesses\n\nA regulator\n\nONDC\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nPowered By\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

These ratings have essentially evolved into the digital proxy for traditional quality standards. However, in the anarchic digital realm, these standards, normally regulated to resist manipulation by marketers, have been subject to exploitation. Platforms and marketers alike use ratings, inflated or manipulated, as convenient lures to entice unsuspecting consumers into spending their money.\n\nIn response to this growing menace of sham reviews and manipulated ratings, the government has time and again pursued solutions to mitigate the resultant chaos for consumers. Notwithstanding these efforts, digital platforms have consistently skirted the implementation of regulations to bring transparency and authenticity in ratings. Yet, in the midst of this, a technology-driven regulatory solution is emerging, a potential remedy for this pervasive issue if policymakers leverage it properly.\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nONDC’s Blockchain System May Bring Ratings Transparency If There’s A Policy Push - News18The blockchain solution can be the game-changer ONDC desperately needs.

One such experiment may come up if the government finds it legally and technically feasible to link e-NAM (electronic National Agricultural Market) with ONDC.\n\nAs the government’s e-NAM has connected 1,389 mandis (agriculture market yards) across the country, an integration may help farmer-producer organisations (FPOs) to navigate both e-NAM and ONDC simultaneously to buy and sell produce, sources said.

As internet accessibility continues to expand and the middle class grows, India's e-commerce sector has witnessed remarkable growth. Deloitte India's 'Future of Retail' report predicts a significant surge in the online retail sector from $70 billion in 2022 to an estimated $325 billion by 2030. This finds resonance in India’s burgeoning e-commerce sector, where the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) has emerged as a catalyst, presenting a tapestry of both opportunities and challenges for these brands.\n\nAt its core, ONDC - a public initiative supported by the government - aspires to engender fair competition and transparent conduct within India’s e-commerce realm. Its cardinal aim revolves around establishing an open, accessible digital commerce ecosystem, particularly nurturing the growth of D2C brands while upholding ethical and equitable business practices.\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nUnlocking Potential: ONDC’s Impact on D2C BrandsIndia’s digitally adept consumer base, with 220 million online shoppers and over 350 million internet users transacting online, continues to fuel e-commerce growth.Indian RetailerGuest author\n\nNews\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is making e-commerce space democratised for all players\n\nNews\n\na year ago · 2 min read\n\nTransactions in ONDC seeing growth across the board\n\nNews\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nTomato Price Rise: NCCF To Sell Subsidised Tomatoes On ONDC In Delhi\n\nNews\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

Trust is necessary at various stages of the transaction - be it for the product, or the money flow or in handling any form of issue / grievance.\n\nThe paramount objective for the Network's success lies in establishing transparency and trust. As the ONDC Network expands, assuring consumers and Network Participants that even in an unbundled environment, accountability can be pegged is paramount. Accountability leads to a Network wide Rating / Scoring which has been developed to offer insights into the performance of entities involved in the digital transaction such as Sellers, Customers, Seller Apps, Buyer Apps, Logistic Service partners, and even Delivery agents.\n\nIntroducing Confidex™, a Blockchain-based solution is being developed with the help of a community based on the CORD blockchain network, open-sourced by Dhiway. This innovative solution will play a pivotal role in facilitating various use cases within the ONDC Network, contributing to the growth of the ecosystem and providing a framework and digital rails for building trust. One example amongst many would be that of Network level Ratings & Score, which will be hosted on Confidex™.\n\nConfidex™ will provide a basis for building an immutable ledger to store the Network Score, thereby facilitating the entire Network ecosystem to establish One pinning source of truth for the Network performance.\n\nConfidex™ is being developed using CORD Network (a federated distributed ledger infrastructure). It is an open-source, layer-one distributed ledger project that revolutionises information management by harnessing the transformative potential of cryptography and designed for population scale.\n\nOnce the foundation is laid out, Confidex™ will pave the way for many other \xa0use-cases, such as Loyalty, Badges & Certifications, to name a few, that require a decentralised framework to be established.\n\nONDC\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nPowered By\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

In a conversation with afaqs!, Shireesh Joshi, CBO, ONDC, says, \"It's important to note that ONDC operates as a protocol, not a consumer-facing application. Businesses build the consumer interfaces, and they are the ones communicating with users. Take UPI, for example; the UPI applications themselves are responsible for advertising. Similarly, existing applications like Paytm serve various payment needs. ONDC seamlessly integrates into these platforms.\"\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nDecoding ONDC’s brand outreach strategyWith prominent names like Google and PepsiCo joining the ONDC bandwagon, Shireesh Joshi, CBO, ONDC, delves into the evolution of brand outreach within the network.afaqs!Akshit Pushkarna\n\nNews\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is making e-commerce space democratised for all players\n\nNews\n\na year ago · 2 min read\n\nTransactions in ONDC seeing growth across the board\n\nNews\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nTomato Price Rise: NCCF To Sell Subsidised Tomatoes On ONDC In Delhi\n\nNews\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) backed app was launched as a competition to cab aggregators Ola and Uber who also operate auto bookings in their apps. Namma Yatri also claimed that it helped auto drivers save almost ₹19 crore through their zero-commission model. In a LinkedIn post, ONDC employee Tina Gurnaney wrote, “Namma Yatri (enabled by ONDC) drivers in Bengaluru have till date collectively earned 189 Cr. 100% of these earnings go to the drivers through a zero commission model. Even if one were to conservatively assume 10% commissions to big players previously, the drivers have collectively saved about 19 Cr in commissions.

In this article, we brief about ONDC, what changes ONDC aspires to bring in digital commerce & how ONDC can promote interoperability in EV Charging.\n\nState of Digital Commerce in India - India’s digital commerce industry has evolved and picked up significant momentum during the past few years which was further accelerated by compulsions on account of COVID-19. The ongoing digital transformation in fuelled by access to internet connectivity at affordable cost, increase in smartphone penetration and increased investments in the start-up ecosystem, together with government innovations like Unified Payment Interface (UPI) etc. India now has the third-largest online shopper base globally, with 14 crore e-retail shoppers in 2020, only behind China and the US.\n\nThe problems with India’s digital commerce infrastructure - On consumer side, still only about ~20% of the internet users in India are shop online. The Gross Merchandising Value (GMV) for the digital commerce retail market in India was ₹2.85 Lakh Crores (US$ 38 billion) in 2020, which is only 4.3% of the total retail GMV in India and well below the e-retail penetration in countries like China (25%), South Korea (26%), and UK (23%). By 2026, digital commerce in the retail sector in India is expected to grow to ₹15 Lakh Crores (US$ 200 billion).

These issues can range from grievances to disputes. Though it must be noted that these issues, while important to address, constitute a small fraction of the overall transactions on the Network. ONDC has a strong track record of successfully completing transactions without grievances.\n\nTo better understand the IGM framework, let's first look at the various entities within ONDC's Network: customers, Buyer Network Participants, Seller Network Participants, sellers, and logistic service providers (LSPs).\n\nOur IGM framework categorises issues into three main types:\n\nIssues between buyers or sellers and other Network Participants (NPs).\n\nDisputes involving two NPs.\n\nIssues between an NP and ONDC itself.\n\nCurrently, our primary focus is on resolving issues between customers and sellers, which they can report through their respective interfacing apps – the buyer app for customers and the seller app for sellers. The party responsible for the issue, whether a Buyer Network Participant, Seller Network Participant, or another NP involved in the transaction, works towards a resolution.\n\nEach issue has a \"Source\" – where it originates, typically the app where it's reported – and a \"Destination\" – the specific entity that resolves it. Our goal is to achieve timely and satisfactory resolutions. However, if the resolution doesn't meet the complainant's satisfaction or the agreed-upon timeframe, the matter can escalate.\n\nThe detailed Issue & Grievance Management process can be accessed (Explainer here)\n\nIn cases where grievances escalate into disputes, we have a plan in place. We use Online Dispute Resolution (ODR), which encompasses three essential methods:\n\nConciliation: Finding common ground for both parties to agree upon.\n\nMediation: Facilitating discussions to reach a mutually acceptable resolution.\n\nArbitration: Reaching a binding decision with the assistance of an impartial authority.\n\nWe are actively working on integrating an automated ODR process into our IGM framework. While a manual process (User Guide) \xa0is currently available, our aim is to create a more efficient, automated system that streamlines the resolution processes.\n\nOnce our fully automated IGM is operational, stakeholders can expect cost-effective, convenient and speedy issue resolution. Our framework is designed to minimise disputes within the network. This ensures that all participants can focus on their core business activities seamlessly.\n\nFor those interested in delving deeper into ONDC's Issue & Grievance Management, we offer additional resources on our IGM Resources page. We invite all stakeholders to embrace this innovative framework, representing a significant step towards creating a fair and transparent digital commerce ecosystem in India.\n\nONDC\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nPowered By\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

ONDC has been conceived—funded initially by banks—as a counterweight against large e-retail, quick commerce and ride-hailing firms. The repository is stored on an ONDC website as well as on YouTube, with assistance from the National Stock Exchange. As ONDC grows, it has started allowing multiple sellers and buyers to hook into a common protocol—rather than on a single platform. The government has cited concentration risks of large e-commerce platforms, as well as “rent seeking” behaviour. At the same time, Thampy Koshy, the Chief Executive Officer of ONDC, said it was necessary to widen the scope of e-commerce to smaller merchants.\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nONDC releases learning resources for merchants as more sellers join platformONDC Academy launched to train merchants on govt-backed e-commerce protocol.

          "Get fresh fruits and veggies home delivered from HOPCOMS through ONDC\n\n\n\nBy \xa0 ONDC\n\nJun 24, 2023\n\nUpdated: Jun 24, 2023\n\n3 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\nBlog\n\nNews\n\nGet fresh fruits and veggies home delivered from HOPCOMS through ONDC\n\nPublication - The Hindu\n\nEdition - Online\n\nAfter failing to make much stride in the online market earlier, the Horticulture Producers’ Cooperative Marketing Society (HOPCOMS) has now hopped on to Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) to deliver fresh fruits and vegetables to consumers’ doorsteps. Under a pilot programme which began in May, around 25 HOPCOMS stalls are taking orders from ONDC now. In the month of May, with a total of 397 orders, HOPCOMS earned a revenue of ₹56,804. The HOPCOMS stall in Basavanagudi near Ramakrishna Ashram, the head office on Marigowda Road, and stalls in Indiranagar, Banashankari (near BDA complex), BEML layout are amongst those from which customers can order on ONDC. “There were many other players in the online market, and we were not active. With central government’s ONDC, we have gotten a good platform. We are seeing around ₹5000-10,000 daily business this month from online orders. Along with being able to deliver on time, we also have the added advantage of being able to deliver fresh fruits and vegetables, unlike other players who might refrigerate their produce,” said N. Devaraj, president, HOPCOMS. He added that mangos were selling well to online customers. With no technical expertise on its side, HOPCOMS has collaborated with Innobits, for tech support in the backend. The technical partner takes care of receiving the orders, conveying them to respective stalls and payment. With the benefit of an open network, any delivery executive associated with any company can deliver the order to the customers and thereby take out logistical worries for HOPCOMS. “The delivery charge has to be borne by the customer,” said Umesh Mirji, Managing Director, HOPCOMS. Decentralised approach this time - Mr. Mirji said that centralisation was the main reason for the online delivery system of HOPCOMS not working efficiently last time. This time, the whole process is decentralised. “As it was very centralised, it was time consuming. Now. We deliver within two kilometre radius of the stalls. With this approach, each unit (stall) will become more independent,” he said. HOPCOMS is currently working on publicising the option to newer customers. “While our regular customers prefer coming to the stalls, this will help us cater to newer, younger customer base,” Mr. Mirji added. With the number of orders increasing each day, HOPCOMS is looking towards business up to ₹1 lakh this month. “If business improves this way, we will definitely extend the programme to other stalls,” Mr. Mirji said. Customers also expressed their happiness about being able to order online from HOPCOMS. “With HOPCOMS, we usually do not have to worry about quality. For fresh fruits and stuff like mushrooms, baby corn, HOPCOMS is always the better option. With ONDC, delivery charges will also be lesser when compared to other websites and I will definitely make use of this option,” said Navya.

With the advent of transformative technological advancements in recent years, the business landscape has witnessed remarkable shifts, presenting a unique set of challenges and opportunities for these dynamic entities. The year 2020 witnessed a staggering presence of approximately 6.33 crore MSMEs, making significant contributions to the nation’s GDP, accounting for approximately 30 per cent thereof, and employing over 11 crore individuals. Spanning across diverse sectors such as manufacturing, services, and trade, these enterprises are now poised to harness the potential unleashed by initiatives focusing on enhanced market access, streamlined digital transactions, improved credit accessibility, data-driven insights, and collaborative ecosystem facilitation. By embracing these digital imperatives, MSMEs are primed to flourish amidst the rapid evolution of the digital landscape, charting a path of sustainable growth and prosperity.\n\nPower of digitization for MSMEs - Digitization has the potential to transform MSMEs by streamlining processes, improving efficiency, expanding market reach, and thereby enhancing customer experiences. By adopting digital tools and platforms, businesses can automate tasks, reduce operational costs, and access valuable data insights for informed decision-making enabling themselves to compete on a level playing field with larger enterprises and tap into global markets.\n\nONDC: Accelerating Digital Commerce - ONDC is a game-changer for MSMEs, aiming to create an open and inclusive digital commerce ecosystem that empowers businesses, especially small-scale entrepreneurs. ONDC provides a unified platform that connects various stakeholders in the digital commerce value chain, including manufacturers, suppliers, logistics providers, and consumers. In the near future, with this intervention, MSMEs can set up their digital stores and reach a wider customer base. The platform offers features like secure payments, logistics support, and customer analytics, enabling businesses to deliver a seamless and personalized shopping experience. Moreover, ONDC facilitates collaboration between MSMEs, fostering partnerships and driving innovation across sectors. For the growth and expansion of MSMEs, it is crucial to have access to credit. Traditional banking systems often pose challenges for small businesses due to complex processes and stringent eligibility criteria. This is where OCEN comes into play. It is an open and interoperable credit enablement network that aims to simplify and democratize credit access for MSMEs. OCEN allows MSMEs to build their credit profiles based on their digital transactions and business history. By leveraging this data, the network enables lenders to assess creditworthiness more accurately and offer tailored financial solutions to businesses. This opens up avenues for MSMEs to access affordable credit, fuel their growth, and invest in technological advancements. With ONDC, MSMEs can set up their digital stores and reach a wider customer base. The platform offers features like secure payments, logistics support, and customer analytics, enabling businesses to deliver a seamless and personalized shopping experience. Moreover, ONDC facilitates collaboration between MSMEs, fostering partnerships and driving innovation across sectors. By leveraging this data, the network enables lenders to assess creditworthiness more accurately and offer tailored financial solutions to businesses. This opens up avenues for MSMEs to access affordable credit, fuel their growth, and invest in technological advancements. By having access to capital, businesses can seize new opportunities, expand their operations, and hire more employees.\n\nDigital-first approach for MSMEs - MSMEs should prioritize digital transformation by digitizing their operations, processes, and customer interactions. This includes setting up user-friendly websites, optimizing online presence through search engine optimization (SEO), and utilizing social media platforms for marketing and customer engagement. By establishing a strong online presence, MSMEs can reach a wider audience and attract potential customers. A well-designed and user-friendly website acts as a virtual storefront, enabling businesses to showcase their products or services effectively. Implementing SEO techniques ensures that the website ranks high in search engine results, driving organic traffic and increasing visibility.\n\nUtilize ONDC’s features - ONDC offers a range of features and tools that MSMEs can leverage to enhance their digital presence and customer experience. By creating compelling product listings, including detailed descriptions and high-quality images, businesses can attract and engage potential customers. Additionally, ONDC provides secure payment gateways, enabling smooth and hassle-free transactions. It also offers logistics support, ensuring efficient order fulfilment and timely delivery. By taking full advantage of these features, MSMEs can provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience, thereby building customer trust and loyalty.\n\nLeverage customer analytics - One of the key advantages of digitization is the availability of valuable data insights. MSMEs should utilize the customer analytics provided by ONDC to understand customer behaviour, preferences, and purchasing patterns. By analysing this data, businesses can tailor their products or services to better meet customer needs and preferences. Customer analytics also enable businesses to identify emerging trends and adapt their strategies accordingly. This valuable information allows MSMEs to make data-driven decisions, optimize marketing campaigns, and personalize customer interactions, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and increased sales.\n\nFoster collaboration and networking - ONDC serves as a platform for collaboration and networking among MSMEs, suppliers, and other stakeholders in the digital commerce ecosystem. By actively participating in this collaborative environment, businesses can forge partnerships, share resources, and access new market opportunities. Collaboration with other MSMEs can lead to economies of scale, reduced costs, and increased market reach. By working together, businesses can combine their strengths, leverage each other’s expertise, and create innovative solutions that benefit the entire ecosystem.\n\nBuild strong credit profile with OCEN - Access to credit is a vital factor in driving the growth and expansion of MSMEs. OCEN provides an opportunity for businesses to build a strong credit profile based on their digital transactions and business history. By maintaining a consistent revenue stream and timely payment of digital transactions, MSMEs can establish their creditworthiness. A robust credit profile enhances the chances of obtaining affordable credit options from lenders. MSMEs can use these funds to invest in infrastructure, upgrade technology, and expand their operations. This, in turn, fuels growth, increases productivity and enables businesses to seize new opportunities in the digital market.\n\nFoster culture of innovation - Digitization opens doors to innovative solutions and approaches. MSMEs should foster a culture of innovation within their organizations, encouraging employees to think creatively and explore new ideas.

It is also in the conversation for enablement of exports through the network. Speaking at the sidelines of a CII event, T Koshy, MD & CEO ONDC, said, “In January, we had just about 50 transactions a day which grew to about 1000 transactions a day in April. Now, they have scaled up to 20,000-30,000 transactions per day. So day by day we are seeing he momentum building. By the end of the year, we expect to build a critical mass. I am hopeful we may see 100,000 transactions per day.” He added that categories such as mobility have also witnessed strong transaction growth. Responding to a query on international transactions, Koshy said, “We believe in a phased fashion the network will be exposed to the world. International buyers will look at accessing the network to buy goods from India as it will offer a wide set of options with the help of logistics network participants. We hope to demonstrate enablement of such transactions this year itself and expect to see some export transactions happeing this year.” ONDC has already received a lot of international attention. “Once we achieve some success, just like UPI, many other countries will look at a similar idea in their market. We have received global attention and we believe such models and ideas will see adoption in others markets too,” Koshy added. ONDC has been seeing growth in network partners, too, with addition of new seller and buyer apps. Earlier this month, the network kickstarted B2B transactions. “We have just started B2B transactions two weeks ago and a couple of B2B transactions have happened. Two more platforms are expected to go live in the next couple of weeks. So we expect to see significant amount of transactions happening in this space,” Koshy added. ONDC has also set up a working group looking at finalising protocols for financial products such as credit and insurance.\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nONDC aims for one lakh daily transactions, explores export enablementOpen Network Digital Commerce (ONDC) plans to achieve 100,000 transactions per day by the end of the year, focusing on groceries, retail, and potential exports.

This collaboration between Protean and NBBL brings together their technological expertise to ensure secure, transparent and seamless fund settlements on the ONDC platform. ONDC and Protean had ideated and conceptualized the RSP along with a few select banks and have successfully tested this first-of-its-kind de-centralized settlement framework between two participants on an open network without the need of any manual intervention or supervision. Network Participants on ONDC are entities who are responsible for enabling Buyer or Seller experiences for their end customers. The Network Participants who have been early adopters of Protean’s RSP include Addble, Bizom, Eksecond, Esamuday, GrowthFalcons, Jakkur Technoparks Private Limited, Kotak Bank App, MyStore, ndhgo, nStore, placeorder.com (Rapidor), Bech.app and OrderDe.com (SignCatch), Spice Money, Snapbizz, Uengage, Vanghee besides many more NPs who are in early stages of integration. Protean’s RSP is built to handle transaction volumes at population scale. This incorporates a number of features including automated rule-driven transaction reconciliation processing system to cater to the dynamic terms of the ONDC order contract and an integrated support for tax calculations. It further provides a 360 degree view admin panel and dashboard for buyer and seller network participants to have complete visibility of their settlement payouts & receivables for transactions originating or terminating on the open network. It also offers exception handling capability and control reports for both Banks and NPs to have operational control and governance.\n\nT. Koshy, CEO and MD at ONDC said, “This marks another significant milestone for ONDC with the launch of Protean’s Recon & Settlement Product on NBBL’s NOCS platform. It will empower participants to focus on their core business activities, confident in the knowledge that their payment settlements are streamlined, accurate, and hassle-free. By embracing this advanced solution, our participants can enhance operational efficiency and ultimately strengthen their trust in the ONDC network, propelling digital commerce to new heights of success.”\n\nSuresh Sethi, MD & CEO, Protean eGov Technologies said, “We are thrilled to collaborate with NBBL and continue to build trust in the ONDC network through products which truly make a difference to the network participants. The introduction of a powerful, decentralized, fully automated Recon and Settlement Product from Protean will ensure elimination of hours of manual effort and reconciliation errors in the payment settlement process in the network. It will ensure seamless funds movement and predictability given the dynamic nature of ONDC contracts. We remain committed to our promise of building population-scale interventions that continue to delight & enhance the ease of doing business.”\n\nNoopur Chaturvedi, CEO of NBBL, said, “We aim to redefine trust in payments and settlements on the Open Network for Digital Commerce. By leveraging our technological expertise and ONDC’s decentralized settlement framework, we are empowering network participants with secure and transparent transactions.

          "“ONDC” is to “digital commerce” what “www” is to “Internet”\n\n\n\nBy \xa0 ONDC\n\nJul 4, 2023\n\nUpdated: Jul 4, 2023\n\n5 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\nBlog\n\nNews\n\n“ONDC” is to “digital commerce” what “www” is to “Internet”\n\nPublication - Medium\n\nEdition - Online\n\nIn this issue, we unbundle the Open Network for Digital Commerce in India and see exactly what is the “journey of an order in the network”, the “advantages of the network” and the “use cases” and what could be the shortcomings of the network. If you want to know the general need for ONDC and the basic user journey follow here : Open Network for Digital Commerce introduces an open network for all the players who can sell or enable selling in the e-commerce setup: a shopping platform, seller, logistic partners and technology service providers. No single entity controls the end-to-end activities in the buyers’ purchase journey as opposed to a platform-centric model. Now, the 3 pillars that ONDC stand on are “interoperability”, “unbundled” and “transparency”. But how does ONDC ensure these? Let us figure it out with a simple diagram. Buyer-side apps (like Paytm) and Seller-side apps (like Magicpin) are listed on the network to provide buyers and sellers access to the network (and they interact with each other through gateways). This helps in the discoverability of products and services. Third-party logistics providers (like Shiprocket) and Financial service providers are connected to the network to provide delivery services, these logistic partners usually would onboard themselves on the seller side apps. E-commerce technology providers (like search engines, payment gateways (like Razorpay), and image recognition) are integrated into the network to facilitate features like query search and product mapping. When a buyer searches for an item on their app, the network will show results from all available sellers regardless of their listing platform, giving buyers multiple options to choose from. For example, a buyer could search for clothes, and see options from Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, and Myntra in the same place (assuming all these services are connected to the ONDC network). Buyers will also be shown the available delivery service providers and choose the cheapest option available (like Dunzo or Shiprocket). This will remove the dependency on expensive delivery options prevalent right now. The buyer can choose the desired seller and delivery provider (based on price, reviews) and make the final payment. The network then facilitates the money transfer and delivery fulfilment by coordinating with all parties involved. So now a new question comes up. Who takes care of what in this process? Who takes care of sending information? Who takes care of searching for products on multiple platforms? A step-by-step journey of order in ONDC - Imagine ONDC as a set of gears that swing into action when the consumer searches for a product on the buyer app such as Paytm. The buyer app relays this search query to a gateway, which searches the ONDC registry. The gateway would then identify the sellers relevant to the search and cast the query to all the registered apps. The apps then fetch the status of the product’s availability from the sellers and relay this information back to the buyer app. The relayed information would be sorted and displayed on the buyer app with the highest relevancy. While the buyer app can define the subset of products and services it wants to be known for (e.g., hyperlocal grocery and online food delivery services), it will need to make public its rules for listing and sorting search results. This is in keeping with network policies to ensure a truly democratic marketplace. Now once the buyer has selected the product from a seller, the seller may fulfil the order on its own or use a logistics service discovered via the network. Depending on the option, the delivery time and cost are transparently shown, and the buyer makes an informed choice about the logistic partner, pays and confirms the order. At the back end, a set of network services keeps ONDC running smoothly, from registries or applications that maintain the list of participants to scoring and badging services that uphold sustainable and transparent practices on the network. Together, all these gears interlock for a tailored outcome based on the consumer’s preferences. Once the order has been confirmed and relayed to all parties, a Transaction-level contract is created and digitally signed by the buyer app and seller app, as well as the seller app and Logistics Service Provider(LSP). The seller app relays the information to LSP(like Shiprocket) and then the LSP takes care of picking up the product and the delivery to the customer. Now that we have clarity of how the participants in the ONDC network interact with each other, let us see some use cases which have come up and could come up in the near future on the network.\n\nMcKinsey in their paper “Democratising Digital Commerce in India, April 2023” has already outlined some uses:\n\nNew possibilities: ONDC could empower farmers with a one-stop solution to boost crop production and increase incomes.\n\nNew possibilities: ONDC could transform India’s largely unorganised, wedding services ecosystem by bringing together various digitalised products and services.\n\nNew possibilities: ONDC could transform the transport ecosystem by stitching together public and private modes of transport for a seamless experience\n\nExisting Application: Namayatri\n\nExisting Application: Unified Energy Interface (UEI): Application of open network in electric vehicles\n\nAcross the digital commerce ecosystem, all the relevant participants such as customers, sellers, and service providers will benefit from an open network in the following ways:\n\nNew and niche ways of seller discovery emerge for consumers\n\nProviders reach further\n\nBuyer and seller apps get efficient\n\nNow that we know almost everything which is there to know about ONDC, we get some doubts also. ONDC is not a complete system yet and still needs a lot of input from the major players in the market such as Amazon and Flipkart who have yet to onboard themselves on the network. And there the doubts come:\n\nWhy would these platforms leverage the infrastructure of being a platform to an open network? What would be the advantage since these are companies that need to create profits to sustain themselves in the market?\n\nWould ONDC still be successful if these big names decide not to join in? Naturally, the Indian market is big enough to cater for both platform-centric companies and open network models. But how will they work together?\n\nHow will ONDC handle returns or damage to products? With unbundling comes partial responsibility. Who would stand responsible for a return or damage to a product?\n\nWhat if the buyer apps decide to show the results of a particular company on top? What should even be the criteria to show products for a search on the buyer apps?\n\nWhich party would handle the division of the funds to the respective participants? And would the other participants be okay with that? Could it lead to misuse of power?\n\nAll these and many such questions will come up as you dive deeper into the ONDC system. All I can say for now is ONDC is in its new stages and growing. New policies and network rules will keep coming up for all the network participants as new edge cases are found. The system is developing and similar to UPI, it could have a massive inflow of users as it develops and moulds itself to fit the market. Till then we can wait and watch how the network unfurls.\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\n“ONDC” is to “digital commerce” what “www” is to “Internet”In this issue, we unbundle the Open Network for Digital Commerce in India and see exactly what is the “journey of an order in the network”…Product UnboxedTanmay Dev\n\nNews\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

This was done post the seller apps density had scaled up in these cities. The main objective of going Beta live is to allow consumers to experience the open network for the first time, collect real-time feedback, and test the network at scale before the pan-India rollout. Bengaluru and Meerut were chosen for the Beta live in September 2022 and December 2022, respectively. The network is now accessible to buyers (consumers) and sellers in these additional five cities. “Consumers will be able to purchase from the sellers on the ONDC network through four active buyer applications — Paytm, Mystore, Spice Money, and Magicpin,” the official statement added. T Koshy, MD and CEO, ONDC, said, “We started with Bengaluru and Meerut and now have a sizable number of sellers, enough to extend the network to other cities. We hope that with this Beta announcement, more and more businesses will be inclined to join us, benefiting from an early-mover advantage. Additionally, as we touch more consumer territories, it also gives us the insights and opportunities to improve the network.” Last month, Koshy said that he hoped the network would see one lakh daily transactions. Currently, the network has 40,000+ sellers live in 200+ cities, out of which 18,000+ sellers operate from these five cities. ONDC had its alpha rollout in April 2022 in five cities to test live transactions with a closed group of sellers and buyers while gradually expanding its footprint.\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nONDC expands beta live coverage to five major Indian citiesThe Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), an initiative by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), has launched its Beta live phase in Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata.The HinduBusinesslineMeenakshi Verma Ambwani\n\nNews\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

          'Google to launch accelerator programme for ONDC\n\n\n\nBy \xa0 ONDC\n\nJun 28, 2023\n\nUpdated: Jun 28, 2023\n\n2 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\nBlog\n\nNews\n\nGoogle to launch accelerator programme for ONDC\n\nPublication - The Economic Times\n\nEdition - Online\n\nTechnology giant Google will soon launch an accelerator programme for the government backed marketplace the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). Will Grannis, the chief technology officer of Google Cloud told ET, "We will be offering ONDC core and infrastructure application programming interfaces (APIs) as open source solutions. This will help them (network participants) join the network faster. We will also be starting a grant programme -- the ONDC startup credits programme -- for $25,000. We are still determining the size. The number of applicants etc., will be determined at a later date. But we will start this programme right away considering its importance." Grannis was speaking on the sidelines of the Google I/O Connect, a first such developers conference in Bengaluru by the company. Separately, ONDC chief executive Thampy Koshy told ET, "Network participants need to implement core and infrastructure APIs in order to join ONDC. This open source solution (by Google) is a ready solution. Retail search and generative AI experiences will improve network experiences with multilingual catalogues, voice search etc. This is all available on Google Cloud." On how retail search and generative artificial intelligence will enhance buyer and seller experiences on the network, Grannis told ET, "generative AI can be useful when you\'re taking a product description or product category and translating it into another language." "There are many local dialects here. That (translation) could save a lot of time. Second, with consumer and buyer preferences changing rapidly, you can see how a product looks in a different colour, and how that would create inbound demand. For artisanal goods or handmade goods which are a large part of businesses that tap into a network like this (ONDC), now you can build it and sell it. You can get demand signals beforehand and build what people actually want," Grannis said. This new offer is targeted at developers and those interested in building and getting plugged into the network, he clarified.\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nGoogle to launch accelerator programme for ONDCGrannis was speaking on the sidelines of the Google I/O Connect, a first such developers conference in Bengaluru by the company on Wednesday.Economic TimesSuraksha P\n\nNews\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.',

Gupta Kirana shop gets a fair chance to compete and showcase his store “digitally” with equal opportunities that other ecommerce players have. Even two years ago, this would not have been possible. Today, it is, thanks to a ground-breaking revolution underway in India. The government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) has the potential to reshape the landscape, propelling India's digital consumption to unprecedented heights. According to McKinsey, this game-changer could increase digital consumption by five times, reaching a staggering $340 billion by 2030. Moreover, the number of digital transacting consumers is projected to surge three to four times, from 165-190 million to 450-500 million users during the same period.\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nONDC is a revolution live in actionWhile UPI primarily focuses on payment transactions, ONDC fosters an entire ecosystem for merchants, ensuring their success in the digital realm.YourStoryDalvir Suri\n\nNews\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

As he explains, there could be premium shops catering to elite clients, there could be the kirana stores frequented by the middle class, street vendors catering to masses and so on. “Every kind of seller is there helping their kinds of clients to buy what is relevant for them using a suitable delivery channel.” However, in the digital commerce marketplace, so far, people think that everything has to be integrated in one approach. “That is why penetration on the buyer side is only five to six percent. And on the seller side just one or two per cent because only a limited set of merchants will be able to use it as per the conditions of the platforms.”\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nONDC: Disrupting e-commerce through participative growthONDC hopes to disrupt digital commerce by unbundling the building blocks of transactions, making it interoperable and inviting everyone to participate in the growth.

With its cutting-edge capabilities and game-changing potential, ONDC wants to completely redefine the world of digital commerce by enhancing the efficiency, security, and transparency of all business dealings. By developing an open, transparent, and secure network that links the many parties involved in e-commerce transactions, ONDC seeks to develop a standardised and interoperable framework for digital commerce, specifically in India. Sellers, purchasers, service providers, logistical partners, and financial institutions are a few of these players.

UPI The Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) came into being in 2016 and its usage picked up soon after the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes by the Indian government that year. This digital public good offers a safe solution for individuals and businesses to make seamless transactions without having to enter details such as one’s bank account. It offers round the clock service. Since being rolled out by the government, UPI has picked up pace with private platforms using the interface to process transactions. Walmart-owned PhonePe dominates the UPI payments space in terms of transactions, followed by Google-owned GPay, and One97 Communications-owned Paytm, among others.\n\nPlease click on the link below:\n\nModi at 9: How RuPay, UPI and ONDC democratised e-commerceThe introduction of UPI, RuPay cards and the open Network for Digital Commerce are revolutionising e-commerce by make it easier for the public to order and purchase goods and for merchants to reach buyers.News9liveIshaan Mittal\n\nNews\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

          "Consumers in Bengaluru to experience and shape ONDC’s new e-commerce revolution\n\n\n\nBy \xa0 Team ONDC\n\nSep 30, 2022\n\nUpdated: Sep 30, 2022\n\n3 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\nBlog\n\nNews\n\nConsumers in Bengaluru to experience and shape ONDC’s new e-commerce revolution\n\nONDC network to start Beta Testing with consumers from 30th September in 16 pin codes.\n\n30th September, 2022: In a significant milestone, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), an initiative of the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce, Government of India, will progressively open its network to consumers via participant applications in 16 pin codes spread across Bengaluru starting 30th September. The objective of the Beta Test is to allow consumers to experience the network for the first time and gather feedback which will help further refine the network before a pan-India roll-out.\n\nTo begin with, consumers can place their orders in two categories – groceries and restaurants through buyer apps participating on the ONDC network.\n\nONDC’s debut in the city of Bengaluru is the first-step in making the entire eCommerce landscape more inclusive, accessible, and experience-driven for all consumers with every seller being visible to every buyer.\n\nConsumers can now shop from multiple (currently two) categories of products and services from any buyer application of their choice. They will now also be able to purchase from every seller listed on the network, including local sellers who were not present on a digital platform earlier and have been e-commerce enabled for the first time. For sellers, this will result in added visibility for their products and services leading to additional revenue. Even their existing customers can see them online via any buyer app and order from them, helping them retain existing trusted relationships.\n\nIn the ONDC terminology, ‘buyer apps’ refers to applications or websites that enable consumers to shop from all sellers available on ONDC. At the start of the Beta Test, consumers can shop online from buyer apps like Mystore, PayTM, and Spicemoney.\n\n‘Seller apps’ are applications or websites that enable sellers to join the network making their catalogs and inventory visible to buyers. Bizom, Digiit, Enstore by Innobits, eSamudaay, eVitalrx, Go Frugal, GrowthFalcons, Mystore, nStore, Seller App, Uengage, and Ushop are the seller apps that are participating in the Beta Test.\n\nDunzo, Loadshare, and Shiprocket are providing logistics services and Protean eGov Technologies Ltd (Formerly NSDL e-Gov) is providing gateway services.\n\nNowFloats and Plotch are technology service providers, facilitating buyer and seller apps to join the ONDC network.\n\nAs various businesses continue to onboard the network, more buyers, sellers, technology service providers, categories, and pin codes will be added progressively. Blowhorn, Craftsvilla, CSC Grameen eStore, Ekart, Global Linker (Faiita IT Mall), Grab, HDFC Bank, IDFC First Bank, ITC Store, Kotak Bank, Magicpin, Microsoft, Peppo, Petpooja, PhonePe, Shopalyst, Snapdeal, and Zoho are in advanced stages of integration and expected to go live shortly.\n\nT. Koshy, MD & CEO, ONDC, said, “This is a milestone for ONDC and e-commerce in India. ONDC will democratize the e-commerce ecosystem by allowing all sellers to access all buyers and all buyers to access all sellers. Even for the Beta Test in Bengaluru, we have chosen the most difficult categories; groceries and restaurants. We are confident this Beta Test will give us important insights which will help us further refine our playbook before a pan-India rollout.”\n\nTo build trust amongst consumers, sellers, and Network Participants (Buyer Apps, Seller Apps & Gateways) in the open network, ONDC has consulted current ecosystem and experts as well as examined best practices for adapting and evolving the best approach to build trust in an unbundled decentralized network. This is explained in a paper that is available now for public consultation on the official social media handles of DPIIT, ONDC, and on www.ondc.org.\n\nAbout ONDC\n\nIncorporated on 31st December 2021, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), a Section 8 company is an initiative of the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce, Government of India, envisioned to create a facilitative model to revolutionize digital commerce, giving greater thrust to penetration of retail e-commerce in India. ONDC is not an application, platform, intermediary, or software but a set of specifications designed to foster open, unbundled, and interoperable open networks thereby eliminating the dependency on a single platform.\n\nMajor ONDC objectives are as follows:\n\n1. Democratisation and decentralization of eCommerce\n\n2. Inclusivity and access for sellers, especially small and medium enterprises as well as local businesses\n\n3. Increased choices and independency for consumers\n\nDownload the Press Release\n\nNews\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

ONDC seeks to achieve something similar for e-commerce.\u200aIt\u200aaims\u200ato\u200a“democratize" digital commerce, moving it away from platform-centric models like Amazon and Flipkart to an open network.

According to people in the know, the system may empower merchants and consumers by breaking the silos that exist today. It will eventually touch every business, from retail goods and food to mobility.\n\nHow would ONDC work?\n\nThe network makes it easier for a small retailers to be discovered. Once a retailer lists its products or services using the ONDC’s open protocol, the business can be discovered by consumers on e-commerce platforms that follow the same protocol. A consumer searching for the product can see the location of the seller and opt to buy from the neighborhood shop that can deliver faster compared to an e-commerce company.

These players have together committed an initial equity of Rs 185 crore, with two-three more shareholders to join before the company is registered.\n\nSeparately, the technology team has simulated a transaction for the ONDC protocol, which will be positioned as a tool where e-commerce players, kirana and other brick-and-mortar retailers and logistics players come and sell their products. “We can go live in a few months. We have already done a hackathon, and more are planned next month to help us develop and finetune it,” government sources told TOI.\n\nThrough organisations such as Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), the government is hoping to rope in sellers on ONDC, which is seen as a first of its kind plan to take on the likes of Amazon and Flipkart that have slowly become entrenched in the market, with brick-and-mortar stores complaining of losing out, partly due to what they allege are deep discounts. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had said that ONDC will create new opportunities and remove monopolistic environments.\n\nWhile some of the traders had sought to counter it through an alternate platform, the initiative has not taken off. Unlike other initiatives, government sources said that like UPI, stakeholders can come and build on it just like PhonePe or Google Pay have developed over the last few years.\n\nE-commerce\n\nKeep reading\n\na year ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC Academy : Your guide to e-commerce enabled by the ONDC Network\n\nONDC Academy\n\nONDC\n\nDigital\n\n2 years ago · 1 min read\n\nONDC is now Beta testing in Meerut!\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\n2 years ago · 2 min read\n\nONDC Incentive Program for Bengaluru Plus:  Inviting all interested participants starting 16th December.\n\nBusiness\n\nONDC\n\nONDC Participant Portal\n\nBegin and efficiently manage your journey on ONDC Network\n\nUnderstand and select your role(s)\n\nTrack, manage and troubleshoot your integration\n\nDiscover and collaborate with others\n\nStay informed on network developments and announcements\n\nPowered By\n\nNo results for your search, please try with something else.",

By following these steps, you\'ll enable seamless interoperability with the decentralized network, allowing your platform to leverage the benefits of ONDC.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGetting Started\n\nQuick Start Guide\n\nThe Protocol\n\nSubscription Process\n\nSigning and Verification\n\nEnabled Domains\n\nReference Applications\n\nUtilities\n\nGetting Started\n\nThe ONDC Web Portal serves as a self-service platform that streamlines interaction between ONDC and its network participants across their entire lifecycle. "Network player" encompasses network participants, ecosystem partners, and other entities engaged with ONDC. The portal provides access to a range of services for network players, such as self-service onboarding, self-monitored compliance, and self-monitored operations. Creating an account on ONDC Web Portal is necessary for starting your integration with ONDC.\n\nQuick Start Guide\n\nONDC Integration Guide is a roadmap designed to illuminate key resources and navigate through the integration journey.\n\nThe Protocol\n\nBeckn is an open protocol that allows local businesses across any industry to be discovered and engaged by any beckn-enabled application. Beckn protocol is a collection of open specifications consisting of protocol APIs, message formats, network design and reference architectures to allow any two entities to execute commercial transactions without being on the same platform.\n\nONDC has provided the network extension layer over the Beckn Protocol (base layer). Over the base layer, the network extension layer comprises model specifications customised to the ONDC context that have been adopted in order to facilitate transactions over the network.\n\nSubscription Process\n\nTo enroll in the ONDC network, Network Participants (NP) must be added to the registry. The steps for an NP to onboard onto the ONDC Registry (Staging, Pre Production, Production) are outlined as follows:\n\nStaging Registry\n\nObtain whitelisting for the subscriber ID.\nInitiate the subscription process by calling the /subscribe API.\nThe complete process i}s {ed here\n\nPre-Production Registry\nAfter presenting a demo and receiving approval from the relevant team, follow the outlined process to be added to the Pre-Prod registry.\n\nProduction Registry\nUpon successfully completing functional testing and satisfying the final checklist in Pre-Production, an NP can transition to the the Production environment.\n\nSigning and Verification\n\nWhen communicating over HTTP using Beckn APIs, the subscribers need to authenticate themselves to perform transactions with other subscribers. Due to the commercial nature of the transactions, every request/callback pair is considered to be a "contract" between two parties. Therefore, it is imperative that all requests and callbacks are digitally signed by the sender and subsequently verified by the receiver.\n\nThe complete process i}s {ed here\n\nEnabled Domains\n\nNetwork Participants are requested to refer to the list here for ONDC defined domains and respective codes, across all environments (Staging, Pre-production and Production). The list will be updated as in when required.\n\nBelow are links to the comprehensive developer guide and model implementations for the enabled domains.\n\nRetail - This domain encompasses subcategories such as grocery, food and beverages, fashion, electronics, home & decor, beauty, and personal care, etc. It facilitates seamless transactions in both B2C and B2B modes, offering a comprehensive shopping experience for consumers and businesses alike.\n\n\nB2C\n\nv1.2\nTest Case Scenarios - B2C\n\n\n\nB2B\n\nv2.0.2\nTest Case Scenarios - B2B\n\n\n\nRetail Developer Guide\n\nFor B2B, select version : release-2.0.2\nFor B2C, select version : draft-1.x\n\nLogistics - This domain streamlines the acquisition of on-network logistics services, providing logistics buyers with a variety of choices for flexible solutions that suit their specific needs.\n\nv1.2\nB2B Logistics\nLogistics Developer Guide\n\nFor B2B Logistics, select version : draft-2.x\n\n\nTest Case Scenarios - Logistics\n\nFinancial Services - This domain facilitates easy access to a spectrum of financial solutions, covering loans, insurance, investments.\n\n\nFinancial Services Developer Guide\n\nFor Loan , select Version : draft-loan\nFor Insurance , select version : draft-insurance\nFor Investments , select version : draft-mutual-funds\n\n\n\nGift Card\n\nTravel & Tourism - This domain enables easy access to a range of travel-related services, covering On-demand Ride hailing with various transport modes, ticket booking without designated seat.\n\n\nMobility Specifications Developer Guide\n\nFor On-demand Ride hailing, select version : draft-TRV10-2.0.0\nFor Unreserved Ticket Booking (metro and intracity bus), select version : draft-TRV11-2.0.0\n\nServices -  This domain empowers individuals to effortlessly access a diverse array of services, covering home services like painting and consulations, etc.\n\nv2.0.0\nServices Developer Guide\n\nAncillary Services\n\nIssue & Grievance Management (IGM) within the ONDC Network serves as a critical mechanism for resolving disputes and concerns among Network Participants (NPs).\n\nv1.0.0\n\n\nReconcillation and Settlement Framework (RSF) plays a pivotal role in maintaining a comprehensive trail of settlements between Network Participants.\n\nv1.0.0\n\n\nRating\n\nv1.2.0\n\n\nScore\n\nv1.2.0\n\n\nTest Case Scenarios (IGM & RSF)\n\nReference Applications\n\nThe network participants need to complete the end-to-end testing with ONDC reference applications.\n\nStaging Environment\n\nONDC Reference Seller App\n\nGithub Repo link\n\nONDC Reference Buyer App\n\nGithub Repo link\n\nONDC Reference Logistics Seller App\n\nGithub Repo link\n\nPre-Production Environment\n\nONDC Reference Seller App\n\nGithub Repo link\n\nONDC Reference Buyer App\n\nGithub Repo link\n\nONDC Reference Logistics Seller App\n\nGithub Repo link\n\nUtilities\n\nSigning and Verification : This tool is designed to support and aid ONDC Network Participants in constructing their own cryptocurrency libraries essential for engaging with the ONDC Network.
